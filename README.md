# Keymeleon Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 14/September/2024  
**Author:** Alec Filios

Keymeleon is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our browser extension operates with regard to user data.

## Data Collection
Keymeleon **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data** from users. The extension operates locally within your browser, and no information about your usage, browsing history, or typing activity is sent to external servers or third parties.

## Local Storage
The only data that Keymeleon stores is your preferred keyboard layout settings, which are saved locally in your browser's storage. This information is stored solely to improve your experience by allowing the extension to remember your preferences between sessions. No personal or sensitive information is involved in this process.

## Third-Party Access
Keymeleon does not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties. Since no personal data is collected, there is no risk of unauthorized access to your information through this extension.

## Permissions
Keymeleon requires certain permissions, such as access to content on web pages and browser storage, to function properly. These permissions are used strictly to remap keyboard inputs and store layout preferences. At no point is any user data collected or transmitted.

## Buy Me a Coffee Link
If you choose to support the developer through the "Buy Me a Coffee" link, you will be directed to an external payment platform. This interaction is entirely optional and occurs outside of the extension itself. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of the payment platform for more details on how your information is handled.

## Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact me on linked in in my bio.

## Support my work

You can support my work by adding or modifying a mapping inside the mappings folder in a new branch.
Keep the following format:
```
[
  {"from":"-", "to":"-"},
  ...
]
```
- "from" are the characters in the english keyboard layout QWERTY
- "to" are the characters of the language/keyboard of your choice (e.g `{"from":"y", "to":"z"}` & `{"from":"z", "to":"y"}` will turn all 'z's into 'y's and vice versa).
- there is no need to add characters that stay the same (e.g `{"from":"a", "to":"a"}`).
- uppercase/capital letters are needed as well (e.g `{"from":"g", "to":"Œ≥"}` & `{"from":"G", "to":"Œì"}`)
- combinations also are needed (e.g `{"from":";a", "to":"Œ¨"}` & `{"from":":;i", "to":"Œê"}`)

Thank you for your contribution!
